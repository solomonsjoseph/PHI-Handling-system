# PHI handling system: infrastructure rewrite phase status

This file is the authoritative carried state for the infrastructure rewrite. The
execution plan, the master architecture prompt, and this file are the only state that
survives a context clear. At every phase gate, record exactly one of
`PASS`, `FAIL`, or `BLOCKED` per phase, with real pass, fail, and skip counts.

Durable spec: `docs/MASTER_ARCHITECTURE_V2.md` (gitignored). Execution plan lives in the
session-local plan file and is quoted into `docs/PHASE_STATUS.md` only where a later phase
must consume an interface or decision.

## Standing sections

### KNOWN_XFAIL

Every `xfail(strict=True)` in the suite is listed here with its nodeid, resolving phase,
and exact reason string. A phase may not close with an unrecorded xfail.

(empty)

### DELETED_TESTS

Every test removed by design is listed here with its nodeid, the production symbol whose
removal justifies it, and the commit that removed that symbol.

(empty)

### RESIDUAL_RISK

Disclosed architectural limitations that no phase can fix. Each entry points at the
threat model or runbook section that discloses it.

## Step 0: durable spec, environment, and baseline

### Completed (prep only, no test runs)

- Master prompt written verbatim to `docs/MASTER_ARCHITECTURE_V2.md` (gitignored, 4690 lines).
- `docs/PHASE_STATUS.md` created and seeded with the baseline table and defect list.
- MongoDB running on `127.0.0.1:27017`, dedicated dbpath
  `/Users/sj1136/.local/share/phi-handling/mongo`, as a persistent hub process `phi-mongo`.
  Note: a separate brew `mongodb-community` service runs on port 55292 and was left untouched.
- Backend server running on `127.0.0.1:8001` (persistent hub process `phi-backend`),
  `DATA_DIR` set to the repo `data/` directory. `/api/health` returns `200` with
  `{"status":"ok","version":"2.0.0"}`.
- Stale environment note in `CLAUDE.md` corrected: `backend/.venv` is Python 3.11.16,
  `numpy==1.26.4`, and `import presidio_analyzer` succeeds.
- Root-suite test deps installed into `backend/.venv`: `faker==40.37.0`, `xlwt==1.3.0`.
  Verified the install did not disturb the `numpy==1.26.4` pin or the Presidio import.

### Deferred: baseline test runs (user present)

The backend serial and `-n auto` baseline, the two `--collect-only` nodeid sets, and the
root suite run are deferred to a session where the user is present. The exact commands are
in the session handoff message. Nothing below Phase R may begin until these are recorded
here with real pass, fail, and skip counts and both nodeid sets committed under
`docs/baseline/`.

## Verified baseline: phases 0 to 3

Evidence gathered on `feat/phi-infrastructure-v2` at `3bf66e8`.

Measured: `pytest tests/test_control_phase{1,2,3}*.py tests/test_control_records_policy.py
tests/test_control_gateway_egress.py -q` gives **123 passed, 4 failed**. Full backend
collection: **1028 tests**.

| Phase | Status | What is actually true |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | PARTIAL | Instruction inventory complete, no nested `CLAUDE.md` or `AGENTS.md`. `INSTRUCTION_BASELINE_STATUS = ALIGNED` at `docs/PRE_IMPLEMENTATION_AUDIT.md:33` is scoped to `main@dcec23a`, which predates all four rewrite commits. `PRECHECK`/`PHASE_0_STATUS` absent. Branch-migration inventory of `feat/agent-design-docs` absent. Baseline test record is pre-rewrite CI data. |
| 1 | PARTIAL | 12 of 25 contracts typed and field-matching. 4 partial, 9 absent. State transitions tested FAIL. No duplicate competing schemas FAIL: `ColumnDecision` (`records.py:576`, unwired) versus the live `JudgeDecision` (`reasoning.py:49`). Only 2 of 8 new records wired. |
| 2 | PARTIAL | Wired and real: ProviderGateway as sole LLM egress, secret blocking, and the sanitize-then-hash-chain trace stack. Zero call sites: SandboxManager (2A), HeaderSafetyGate and SourceProjectionGateway (2E), MethodRegistry. Absent entirely: artifact lineage invalidation (section 30). |
| 3 | PARTIAL | `HandoffGateway` deny-by-default and correct, 22 tests, 11 of 12 checks, 6 of 7 topology edges. Zero call sites. Both exit criteria unmet. |

## Defects found during review

| ID | Location | Defect |
|---|---|---|
| D1 | `sandbox.py:154-155` | `os.environ.clear()` runs before `_stripped_env()` reads `os.environ`, so it returns `{}`. The credential denylist is dead code. The child also loses `PATH`/`HOME`/`TMPDIR`. |
| D2 | `sandbox.py:189-196` | `proc.join()` precedes `queue.get()`. CPython deadlock: any result larger than the ~64 KiB pipe hangs until the 120 s wall clock, then raises a spurious `SandboxTimeout`. |
| D3 | `sandbox.py:162,198` -> `superorchestrator.py:341-342` -> `events.py:118-135` | The child forwards raw exception text, which embeds the offending cell. `append()` sanitizes `payload` only, so the raw value is SHA-256 chained and streamed over SSE. |
| D4 | `events.py:118-135`, `records.py:525` | `TraceEvent.status_text` is never sanitized and already carries column names. |
| D5 | `opaque.py:34`, `records.py:215`, `superorchestrator.py:555-565` | `OpaqueMap.to_opaque` stores the raw canonical value in cleartext, unencrypted. |
| D6 | `crypto.py:135-152` | `pseudonym_salt` and the signature half of `sign_principal_cookie` are byte-identical for the same input (no domain separator). Cookies carry no issued-at, nonce, or key version. |
| D7 | `_DENYLIST_ENV_FRAGMENTS`, `sandbox.py:53` | Matches `API_KEY`, `SECRET`, `TOKEN`, `PASSWORD`, `CREDENTIAL`, `MONGO_URL`. Misses `APP_ENCRYPTION_KEY`, `ATTESTATION_SIGNING_KEY`, `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `DATABASE_URL`, `SSH_AUTH_SOCK`. |
| D8 | `conftest.py:4-5` | Claims tests guard on `MONGO_URL`. False: zero Mongo skip guards exist. |
| D9 | `sandbox.py:82-83` | `mkdir(parents=True, mode=0o700)` applies the mode to the leaf only; the `run_id` intermediate is umask-derived. |
